# average-imdb-scores-by-actors-actresses

* I created a table with 112.332 actors/actresses and average [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/) ratings of movies they had a role in it by using some of the [datasets](https://datasets.imdbws.com/) that [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/) shares.

* I used:
  1. name.basics.tsv.gz
  2. title.basics.tsv.gz
  3. title.principals.tsv.gz
  4. title.ratings.tsv.gz
